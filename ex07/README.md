# PROGRAM 7 : INTER-PROCESS COMMUNICATION USING SHARED MEMORY

## AIM :
To demonstrate inter-process communication between processes using shared memory segments and implement operations to create, access, modify, and release shared memory resources.

## CONTEXT :
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is the set of mechanisms that allow processes to communicate (using Shared memory, Pipes, Sockets, Signals) and synchronize with each other while running. 
We explore, Shared memory: It is one of the fastest IPC mechanisms because multiple processes can directly access the same region of memory without repeatedly transferring data between them.

## LINUX SYSTEM CALLS / FUNCTIONS USED

| System Call / Function | Function |
|---|---|
| `shm_open()` | Creates or opens a shared memory object. |
| `ftruncate()` | Sets the size of the shared memory object. |
| `mmap()` | Maps the shared memory object into the process's address space. |
| `fork()` | Creates a child process. |
| `wait()` | Makes the parent process wait until the child process finishes. |
| `munmap()` | Removes the mapped shared memory region from the process's address space. |
| `close()` | Closes the shared memory object descriptor. |
| `shm_unlink()` | Deletes the shared memory object from the system after use. |
| `sleep()` | Suspends execution for a specified number of seconds (used here to ensure the parent writes before the child reads). |
